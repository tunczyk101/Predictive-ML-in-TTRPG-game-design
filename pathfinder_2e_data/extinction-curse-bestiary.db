A lone herecite cut off from its creators-often because it is the sole remnant of a destroyed temple or its master has perished-may wander far and wide in search of a cabal to join. Other times, the herecite seeks out a place sacred to the deity it worshipped in life.

If the damage doesn't correspond to the image of the monster-for example, if an illusory Large dragon deals only 5 damage-the GM might allow the target to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if the illusion wields a warhammer and attacks a creature resistant to bludgeoning damage, the creature would take less mental damage.

At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example.

To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet.

Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious.

Among the resource-poor xulgaths who dwell in the Darklands, especially those hardy clutches that call the Black Desert their home, obsidian is one of the most common crafting materials available. Combine this ingredient with a powerful spellcaster and the xulgath tradition of inflection-magically warping and working normally inflexible stone-and the end result is an obsidian golem.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking.

There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking.

This effect is desirable for some-particularly the circuses, menageries, and royal courts that typically purchase these glowing beasts-but never for the animal itself. Because the effects of the transformation are so deleterious, the act of creating an iridescent animal is strongly frowned upon by druids and other naturalists, some of whom dedicate their lives to rescuing and fostering these maltreated creatures. The procedure cannot be reversed, and few iridescent animals are fit to live in the wild after the transformation, cementing their lot in life to serve as showy beasts of burden or objects of entertainment and ridicule.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #152: Legacy of the Lost God"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":16},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":9},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"traits":{"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":[]},"rarity":"uncommon","senses":{"value":"scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"size":{"value":"huge"},"value":["animal"]},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.extinction-curse-bestiary.x2XcPDPLeCAXITlZ"}}}
