Most troops start with 16 squares (4 by 4), and their Hit Points have two listed thresholds, typically the first is at 2/3 their maximum Hit Points and the second is at 1/3 their maximum Hit Points. Once the troop drops below the first threshold, it loses 4 squares, leaving 12 squares remaining, and the first threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. Once the troop falls below the second threshold, it loses another 4 squares, leaving 8 squares remaining, and the second threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. In order to restore its size and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen. At 0 Hit Points, the troop is reduced down to 4 squares, which is too few to sustain the troop, so it disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, fleeing, or easily dispatched, depending on their nature.</p>\n<p>A damaging single-target effect, such as a Strike, can't force a troop to pass through more than one threshold at once. For instance, if a troop had 60 Hit Points, with thresholds at 40 and 20, a Strike for 50 damage would leave the troop at 21 Hit Points, just above the second threshold. A damaging area effect or multi-target effect can cross multiple thresholds at once and could potentially destroy the entire troop in one shot.</p>\n<p>Non-damaging effects with an area or that target all creatures in a certain proximity affect a troop normally if they affect the entire area occupied by the troop. If an effect has a smaller area or numbers of targets, it typically has no effect on the troop. However, if the effect can target at least four creatures or cover at least four squares in the troop, and if it would prevent its targets from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more, the troop loses loses a number of Hit Points equal to the amount required to bring it to the next threshold, removing 4 squares. If an effect would both deal damage and automatically cross a threshold due to incapacitating some of the creatures in the troop, apply the damage first.

Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can move the spiritual guardian to an unoccupied space next to a target within range (if necessary) and make a Strike with it. The guardian uses and contributes to your multiple attack penalty. Alternatively, when you Sustain the Spell, you can have the guardian move adjacent to an ally and protect that ally. If you do, each time the ally would take damage, the guardian takes the first 10 damage instead of your ally. It continues to do so until you move the guardian to attack an enemy or defend a different ally, or until the guardian is destroyed (it has 50 Hit Points and can't recover Hit Points by any means). The guardian can't usually take damage except when protecting an ally, though <em>disintegrate</em> automatically destroys it if it hits the spiritual guardian's AC of 25.</p>\n<p>The guardian's Strikes are melee spell attacks. Regardless of the appearance of the guardian's weapon, the guardian deals force damage equal to 2d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier, but you can deal damage of the type normally dealt by the weapon it holds instead of force damage. No other traits or statistics of the weapon apply, and even a ranged weapon attacks adjacent creatures only. Despite making a spell attack, the spiritual guardian's weapon is a weapon for the purposes of triggers, resistances, and so forth.</p>\n<p>The guardian takes up space and allies can use it when flanking, but it doesn't have any other attributes a creature would normally have aside from Hit Points, and creatures can move through its space without hindrance. The guardian can't make any attack other than its Strike, and feats or spells that affect weapons or enhance allies do not apply to the guardian.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> The guardian's damage increases by 1d8, and its Hit Points increase by 20.</p>"},"duration":{"value":"sustained up to 1 minute"},"hasCounteractCheck":{"value":false},"heightening":{"damage":{"0":"1d8"},"interval":1,"type":"interval"},"level":{"value":5},"location":{"value":"NXMeYsCWfTIdulOD"},"materials":{"value":"You have a deity."},"prepared":{"value":""},"primarycheck":{"value":""},"range":{"value":"120 feet"},"rules":[],"save":{"basic":"","value":""},"school":{"value":"abjuration"},"secondarycasters":{"value":""},"secondarycheck":{"value":""},"slug":"spiritual-guardian","source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"spellType":{"value":"attack"},"sustained":{"value":false},"target":{"value":""},"time":{"value":"2"},"traditions":{"value":["divine"]},"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["force"]},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"spell"},{"_id":"K4d7FpXASk56vO1T","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.4DaHIgtMBTyxebY3"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/commanding-lash.webp","name":"Commanding Lash","sort":1500000,"system":{"ability":{"value":""},"area":null,"category":{"value":"focus"},"components":{"focus":false,"material":false,"somatic":false,"verbal":true},"cost":{"value":""},"damage":{"value":{}},"description":{"value":"<p>With the threat of more pain, you compel a creature you've recently harmed.
