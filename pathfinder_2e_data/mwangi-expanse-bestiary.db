Though no more intelligent than any other beast, it usually acts with extreme paranoia, dodging traps or ambushes with an uncanny acumen.

Due to its constant feeding on decaying flesh, a rompo's mouth is filled with rot, parasites, and deadly pathogens. Its bite can impart these combined infections as a dangerous disease known as rompo chills. The disease causes its victim to tremble uncontrollably, lightly at first but eventually developing into a violent shaking that ends with the victim's death.
