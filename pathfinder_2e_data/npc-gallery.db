The Hellknight armiger presented here might be an unrepentant enforcer seeking to quell rebellion among the oppressed, a dedicated monster hunter, a censor of artistic innovation, a savior to victims of kidnapping, a spy and torturer, or a lawful crusader against demonic incursions.

The virtuous defender could be a member of a knightly squad or a recruiter seeking those willing to risk their lives to save Avistan from a terrible peril. The veteran reclaimer is likely found in the depths of the Gravelands or other truly forsaken realms, where even the slightest misstep can lead to death or worse.
