For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","handsHeld":0,"inSlot":false,"invested":null},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"group":"brawling","hardness":0,"hp":{"brokenThreshold":0,"max":0,"value":0},"level":{"value":2},"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"potencyRune":{"value":1},"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"price":{"value":{"gp":35}},"propertyRune1":{"value":null},"propertyRune2":{"value":null},"propertyRune3":{"value":null},"propertyRune4":{"value":null},"quantity":1,"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"rules":[],"size":"med","slug":"handwraps-of-mighty-blows","source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"splashDamage":{"value":null},"stackGroup":null,"strikingRune":{"value":"striking"},"traits":{"rarity":"common","value":["agile","finesse","invested","magical","nonlethal","transmutation","unarmed"]},"usage":{"value":"worngloves"},"weight":{"value":"-"},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"weapon"},{"_id":"NBUlKm3GztSseKbH","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.dDIPA1WE9ESF67EB"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/adventuring-gear/clothes-explorers.webp","name":"+1 Clothing (Explorer's)","sort":700000,"system":{"armor":{"value":0},"baseItem":"explorers-clothing","category":"unarmored","check":{"value":0},"containerId":null,"description":{"value":"<p>Explorer's clothing is sturdy enough that it can be reinforced to protect you, even though it isn't a suit of armor.

Countless stories describe anugobus sneaking around Minatan cities to tinker with and improve upon other humanoids' structures and architecture. Owing to their slight stature and relatively frail bodies, anugobus are said to be particularly shy of larger peoples and creatures. Whether under cover of darkness, during a festival that draws people away from their domiciles, or simply whenever they think they're unseen, anugobus in folklore perform their wondrous restorations and crafting projects in secret nearly without exception. Many popular Tengah stories feature homes ruined by a natural disaster that are then magically restored the next morning or unfinished projects like half-built bridges that are mysteriously completed while its workers wonder at how this was accomplished.</p>\n<p>According to most legends, anugobus are unparalleled masters of architecture and engineering and use this expertise to erect complex structures or greatly improve upon already-existing buildings. Some have questioned these extraordinary stories, but anyone who witnesses an anugobu walk on the walls and ceilings of buildings while improving them knows that such tales aren't that far-fetched. In reality, anugobus are as diverse as any species of humanoid, though they all possess innate gifts for mending and construction, and they can walk on walls and ceilings. Anugobus resemble exceptionally small humans with superficial similarities to Tian-Sings. Most anugobus stand no more than 2 feet tall and weigh about 30 pounds-a diminutive stature that allows them to move in and out of crevices and remain unnoticed by taller folks. Nearly all verifiable anugobu encounters have taken place on the isles of Minata.</p>\n<p>In many anugobu cultures, each anugobu seeks an ultimate life goal, which they call their wonder. A wonder is any particular project that enraptures an anugobu in a way no other will. Any project can be an anugobu's wonder, from repairing a majestic cathedral to hunting a particularly dangerous animal to exploring a mysterious cave. When an anugobu discovers their wonder, it's not uncommon for them to fall into an awestruck trance and commit themselves fully to completing the work, sometimes binging on the project for days or weeks at a time. When an anugobu finishes the last minute details on their wonder, their life's work is considered complete, and they spend the rest of their days aiding other anugobus with their own journeys or taking on apprentices to pass on their skills.</p>\n<p>Most young anugobus undertake not just one, but many apprenticeships in order to learn advanced techniques in their trade of choice. The apprentice depicted here specializes in construction and engineering, but an anugobu is just as likely to take up cooking, hunting, tailoring, or really anything that piques their interest.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":8},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":12},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":7}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["anugobu","common","sylvan","terran"]},"rarity":"uncommon","senses":{"value":"low-light vision"},"size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["anugobu","humanoid"]},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.fists-of-the-ruby-phoenix-bestiary.dTcsY3v9lg4BRrsj"}}}

Their shadowy, incorporeal forms are dotted with burning eyes that reffect their hatred for the living, and shadowy claws are weapon enough to steal the vitality from their enemies. A wraith may be created by foul necromancy, but more often they are the result of a hermitic murderer or mutilator who even in death could not give up their wicked ways. Further complicating the matter is the fact that wraiths multiply by consuming and transforming the living into more of their foul kind-meaning a handful of wraiths left unchecked can easily turn into a horde of darkness.</p>\n<p>Wraiths weigh nothing and are unharmed by most physical attacks. They haunt any place where they can feed on the living, though their vulnerability to sunlight confines them to the shadowy places of the world-places where they can blend in seamlessly with their dark surroundings before silently engulfing their prey.</p>\n<p>Wraiths may form packs with others of their kind in places where death and mayhem are commonplace-countrysides ravaged by war, metropolitan underworlds run by criminal overlords, or sites of fiendish cultic rituals. In these places, the living do well to tread with sunrods and powerful clerics in tow. Ruins, sewers, and abandoned buildings provide sanctuary for wraiths during the day, as the creatures hunt exclusively at night or in dark places. Wraiths are smart enough to take advantage of their incorporeality in combat, so they keep to tortuous caverns or structures with hallways and avoid open areas.</p>\n<p>As they're formed purely of anti-life from the Negative Energy Plane, wraiths pervade that unholy realm. Within nations and civilizations ruled by the undead, wraiths have places of power as assassins and spies. They're among the ruling class in Geb, but have greater numbers in Ustalav, where packs of wraiths roam graveyards and misty trails, consuming the populations of entire villages. In other parts of the world, wraiths tend not to wander and limit their activity to smaller environs, typically just the site of their chosen haunting and its immediate surroundings.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":22},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":28},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":28}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["necril","tien"]},"rarity":"unique","senses":{"value":"darkvision, lifesense 60ft"},"size":{"value":"med"},"value":["incorporeal","undead","wraith"]},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.fists-of-the-ruby-phoenix-bestiary.ka41qAFCgGFBXUPJ"}}}

Their short, stubby wings may give them a comical appearance, but anyone who's been on the receiving end of the beast's powerful beak finds the experience less than amusing. Dromornis use their beaks to easily tear flesh and sinew from prey's bones, quickly dispatching sizable mammals like deer, tapirs, and primates. Particularly hungry or aggressive dromornises have even been known to attack humanoids. The bird's strong legs sport sharp talons that, while secondary in combat to its beak, can nonetheless trample and shred smaller creatures like rodents and amphibians caught underfoot.</p>\n<p>While a lone dromornis is dangerous enough, a pack of dromornises can take down a den of bears or village of humanoids. A dromornis pack typically consists of three or four adults and up to five juveniles, all of whom work in tandem to overpower larger prey. Packs lie in wait for something like an anaconda, boar, buffalo or, in cases of desperation, a dinosaur to emerge, then move as one for a surprise strike. Dromornises aren't particularly intelligent, but they have been known to use an ingenious (if hazardous) decoy tactic, luring in massive prey by putting one of their own fledglings at risk.</p>\n<p>Dromornises most often live in tropical jungles far from the reaches of civilization, though they sometimes make their homes in mountainside caves or along rocky coastlines. While most onlookers would be hard-pressed to tell one dromornis from another, dromornises maintain tight familial structures based on pheromones and scent glands, so it's obvious when a straggler from another family is trying to encroach on a pack's den. Such disputes over breeding grounds are common; a particularly prized dromornis den might change hands several times in the course of a year. Fights between dromornis packs are chaotic and swift, marked with the sounds of terrifying screeches and sprays of blood.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":20},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":21},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":17}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":[]},"rarity":"uncommon","senses":{"value":"low-light vision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"size":{"value":"lg"},"value":["animal"]},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.fists-of-the-ruby-phoenix-bestiary.tBQgipDUVhamBNrZ"}}}

Countless stories describe anugobus sneaking around Minatan cities to tinker with and improve upon other humanoids' structures and architecture. Owing to their slight stature and relatively frail bodies, anugobus are said to be particularly shy of larger peoples and creatures. Whether under cover of darkness, during a festival that draws people away from their domiciles, or simply whenever they think they're unseen, anugobus in folklore perform their wondrous restorations and crafting projects in secret nearly without exception. Many popular Tengah stories feature homes ruined by a natural disaster that are then magically restored the next morning or unfinished projects like half-built bridges that are mysteriously completed while its workers wonder at how this was accomplished.</p>\n<p>According to most legends, anugobus are unparalleled masters of architecture and engineering and use this expertise to erect complex structures or greatly improve upon already-existing buildings. Some have questioned these extraordinary stories, but anyone who witnesses an anugobu walk on the walls and ceilings of buildings while improving them knows that such tales aren't that far-fetched. In reality, anugobus are as diverse as any species of humanoid, though they all possess innate gifts for mending and construction, and they can walk on walls and ceilings. Anugobus resemble exceptionally small humans with superficial similarities to Tian-Sings. Most anugobus stand no more than 2 feet tall and weigh about 30 pounds-a diminutive stature that allows them to move in and out of crevices and remain unnoticed by taller folks. Nearly all verifiable anugobu encounters have taken place on the isles of Minata.</p>\n<p>In many anugobu cultures, each anugobu seeks an ultimate life goal, which they call their wonder. A wonder is any particular project that enraptures an anugobu in a way no other will. Any project can be an anugobu's wonder, from repairing a majestic cathedral to hunting a particularly dangerous animal to exploring a mysterious cave. When an anugobu discovers their wonder, it's not uncommon for them to fall into an awestruck trance and commit themselves fully to completing the work, sometimes binging on the project for days or weeks at a time. When an anugobu finishes the last minute details on their wonder, their life's work is considered complete, and they spend the rest of their days aiding other anugobus with their own journeys or taking on apprentices to pass on their skills.</p>\n<p>Once an anugobu apprentice sets out on their own, they travel the world working on small projects here and there to maintain their skills. But an anugobu does not earn the honorable title of wondercrafter until they find their own wonder. Once they discover and finish such a wonder, the anugobu is considered fully mature. As a result of their station and experience, such anugobus possess skills and magic that far surpass most of their kind.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder #166: Despair on Danger Island"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":13},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":19},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":14}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["anugobu","common","sylvan","terran"]},"rarity":"uncommon","senses":{"value":"low-light vision"},"size":{"value":"tiny"},"value":["anugobu","humanoid"]},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.fists-of-the-ruby-phoenix-bestiary.yNqeqEULKA536K4r"}}}
