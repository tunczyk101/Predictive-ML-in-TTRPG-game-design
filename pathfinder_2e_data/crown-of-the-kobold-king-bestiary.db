Even though these creatures have a rudimentary intelligence, they don't have any social structure to speak of. Most gricks are encountered alone.

Capable predators, gricks also have a strangely weapon-resistant hide that makes them especially dangerous to the unprepared. Many novice adventurers have fallen to grick attacks merely because they couldn't damage these creatures with their non-magical weapons.

The traditional method of creating a mummy guardian is a laborious and sadistic process that begins well before the poor soul to be transformed is dead, during which the victim is ritualistically starved of nourishing food and instead fed strange spices, preservative agents, and toxins intended to quicken the desiccation of the flesh. The victim remains immobile but painfully aware during the final stages, where its now-useless entrails are extracted before it's shrouded in funerary wrappings and entombed within a necromantically ensorcelled sarcophagus to await intrusions in the potentially distant future. While it's certainly possible to use other methods to create a mummy guardian from an already-deceased body, those who seek to create these foul undead as their guardians in the afterlife often feel that such methods result in inferior undead-the pain and agony of death by mummification being an essential step in the process.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the method of their creation, mummy guardians are more than just physical shells of flesh and bone-they retain fragmented, distorted versions of their minds, with only enough memories of their living personality remaining to fuel their undead anger and jealousy of those who yet live.

When clinging to a cave roof, and with their bulbous red eyes closed down to squints, darkmantles in ambush look similar to stalactites. Their preferred hunting method works best on creatures without darkvision, so they frequent ruins aboveground or shallow caves not far from the outside world. When darkmantles sense prey, they shed darkness down onto their prey before dropping away from the ceiling to flap quickly down to their victim, whereupon these beasts clutch and squeeze with their thick, muscular tentacles.

As a result, generations of darkmantles quickly accrue, and over the years, they've developed a similarly rapid propensity to adapt to new locations. Aquatic caverns, for example, might be infested with darkmantles that can swim instead of fly; on the other hand, icy caverns would've led to darkmantles that developed white or pale blue colorations, and these specimens might produce blasts of obscuring fog instead of darkness. The deepest, darkest reaches of the Darklands are rumored to host darkmantles of incredible size, capable of smothering multiple human-sized victims simultaneously.

He intended for the crown to bolster his ability to rule and herald in a new era of a dwarven kingdom that followed the teachings of Droskar. Yet Gristogar wasn't equal to his own ambitions, and before he could complete the Crown of Toil, his cult died out and he ended his own life. For centuries, the incomplete crown lay dormant, but over that time, fragments of Gristogar's soul infused it-not enough to transform it into a truly intelligent item, but enough to give it a rudimentary need and desire to be completed.</p>\n<p>When the Kobold King Merlokrep discovered the discarded crown and placed it upon his head, the crown at last had agency- if not in a hale and hearty dwarf, at least in the frame of a powerful and ambitious kobold. Just as the crown began influencing Merlokrep, so too did the Kobold King's personality influence the crown. Today, the device is known as the <em>Crown of the Kobold King</em>, and while it still urges the one who wears it to build a kingdom of endlessly toiling workers, it no longer does so in honor of Droskar. Instead, it seeks the rise of a brutal kobold kingdom.</p>\n<p>The crown appears as a golden band surrounded by iron spikes that glisten with fresh blood-the addition of a kobold skull to the top is largely decorative, but one the crown has grown to \"enjoy.\" Even in its incomplete state, a few rituals away from its true potential, the Crown of the Kobold King is a potent item.
