Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient prey-humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible. This doesn't comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies.

In most cases, these fragments simply disperse on their own, but when dreamers flee from nightmares back to the waking world, these fragments can take on a supernatural life of their own. They have little reasoning and intent except to seek similar fragments, absorb them, and grow. When enough of them gather together, they merge into a horrific form as an animate dream.</p>\n<p>Individually, animate dreams can hold a wide range of appearances, but most take on rudimentary shapes akin to the living forms of the minds that spawned them. Animate dreams that rise from slumbering humanoids, the most commonly encountered, thus appear humanoid, but with distorted, nightmarish shapes that incorporate additional twisted limbs and frightening features. In these forms, animate dreams find their way out of the Dreamlands and into the waking world, only to discover they have no way of returning and suffer a relentless hunger that only new nightmares can sate.</p>\n<p>An animate dream thrives on the terror fueled by nightmares and fear and uses its supernatural abilities to invoke such feelings in the minds of its victims, cursing its prey by creating a permanent link to that individual's dreams. Thereafter, the victim is subjected to all manner of reoccurring nightmares. As the nightmares continue, the victim finds it more and more difficult to remain awake. In the end, the victim plunges into an accursed slumber from which it cannot return. These victims provide the animate dream with the purest form of fear and are its preferred sustenance.</p>\n<p>An animate dream can subsist on the ambient fear generated by regular nightmares, but these lesser fears aren't as satisfying, often driving the animate dream to seek out new victims. Left without a source of fear, an animate dream won't starve to death, but it will grow increasingly violent and desperate. Famished animate dreams are the ones most often encountered, as they have been forced to abandon subtlety to pursue more blatant methods of harvesting fear. Yet such animate dreams also tend to be the least powerful of their kind. Those who have grown metaphysically fat on fear have generally done so by adopting a specific nightmare theme, such as being buried alive, being swept away by ocean waves, or being consumed by wild beasts. Such animate dreams often have similarly themed innate spells to augment their powers.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-07: A Most Wondrous Exchange!"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":14},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":17},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":13}},"traits":{"attitude":{"value":"hostile"},"languages":{"custom":"Telepathy 100 feet","selected":[],"value":[]},"rarity":"rare","senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"med"},"value":["dream","incorporeal"]},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-4-bestiary.576LENfQB9u4V92Y"}}}

They use captivating songs to lure creatures in, then murder them while they stand transfixed. They enjoy causing confusion and fear in their prey before they strike, believing it creates a savory flavor in the flesh. Harpies can eat most creatures but strongly prefer sapient prey-humans and elves are their favorite. Although harpies will eat goblins if sufficiently hungry, they dislike their flavor and avoid eating them if possible. This doesn't comfort goblins, of course, who have a particularly strong fear of harpies. Because their aeries often reek with the gore of their kills and careless spatters of guano, harpies carry a distinctly vile scent that canny travelers associate with danger. Harpies who roost close to civilization make better efforts to keep clean, though these efforts have mixed results.</p>\n<p>Harpies live in family groups or larger clans. They are lightweight despite their size, standing 5 feet tall and weighing only around 90 pounds. While most use relatively simple weapons, some harpies take pride in learning and mastering the use of more complex tools of war such as swords and slings. Those who master the use of the bow, in particular, are often regarded as heroes among their kind and terrors among their victims.</p>","source":{"value":"Pathfinder Society Scenario #4-06: Signal from the Electric Laboratory"}},"resources":{},"saves":{"fortitude":{"saveDetail":"","value":15},"reflex":{"saveDetail":"","value":21},"will":{"saveDetail":"","value":18}},"traits":{"languages":{"custom":"","selected":[],"value":["common"]},"rarity":"uncommon","senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"size":{"value":"med"},"value":["humanoid"]},"schema":{"version":0.827,"lastMigration":null}},"type":"npc","flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.pfs-season-4-bestiary.7Njvm0rs09uwz7wv"}}}

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet.

Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.z9T4c1hXwOotsMCp]{Holy Water}</em> while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}.

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25|name:Overcome Revulsion] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/br 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li>\n<li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.z9T4c1hXwOotsMCp]{Holy Water}</em> while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed.

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet.

Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.z9T4c1hXwOotsMCp]{Holy Water}</em> while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}.

At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet.

Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious.

A typical vampire can't voluntarily cross running water unless it is transported while it hides within its coffin, nor can it enter a private dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet. After 1 round of being exposed to the subject of its revulsion, a vampire can attempt a @Check[type:will|dc:25|name:Overcome Revulsion] save as a single action, which has the concentrate trait. On a success, it overcomes its revulsions for [[/br 1d6 #rounds]]{1d6 rounds} (or 1 hour on a critical success).</li>\n<li><strong>Stake</strong> A wooden stake driven through a vampire's heart drops the vampire to 0 HP and prevents it from healing above 0 HP, even in its coffin. Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious. If the stake is removed, the vampire can heal above 0 HP again, and if it's in its coffin the 1-hour rest period begins once the stake is removed. If the vampire's head is severed and anointed with <em>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.z9T4c1hXwOotsMCp]{Holy Water}</em> while the stake is in place, the vampire is destroyed.</li>\n<li><strong>Sunlight</strong> If exposed to direct sunlight, a vampire immediately becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1}. The slowed value increases by 1 each time the vampire ends its turn in sunlight. If the vampire loses all its actions in this way, it is destroyed.

As barghests have no innate ability to travel the planes, though, the time it takes for most greater barghests to engineer such a return can usually be measured in years, if not decades. During that time, greater barghests continue to play the roles of gluttons, hunters of humanity, and tyrants of goblinoid tribes. More than a few grow accustomed to such lives on the Material Plane and wholly abandon the end goal of returning to the Abyss, despite the fact that those who do make such a return home often grow even more powerful over time, gaining eerie new abilities and qualities absorbed from the raw chaos of the Abyss itself.</p>\n<p>In addition to greater barghests being more powerful than typical barghests, the process of transforming into a greater barghest results in hideous mutations that often grant deadly abilities.

At your discretion, vampires might have different compulsions-a pirate vampire might not be able to set foot on solid ground without being invited, for example. The vampire can still be forced to do these things and might be able to overcome its compulsion just as it does its revulsion.</li>\n<li><strong>Revulsion</strong> A vampire can't voluntarily come within 10 feet of brandished garlic or a brandished religious symbol of a non-evil deity. To brandish garlic or a religious symbol, a creature must Interact to do so for 1 round (similar to Raising a Shield). If the vampire involuntarily comes within 10 feet of an object of its revulsion, it gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.sDPxOjQ9kx2RZE8D]{Fleeing} condition, running from the object of its revulsion until it ends an action beyond 10 feet.

Staking a vampire requires three actions and works only if the vampire is unconscious.
