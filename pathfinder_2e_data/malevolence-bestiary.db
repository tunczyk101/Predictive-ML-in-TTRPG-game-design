A heartbeat later, the feeling fades away.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>The PC can hear what sounds like a small bird trapped in a wall, struggling for escape; no other PC can hear it. A few moments later, the PC feels that they're the trapped bird, and then the phantasm fades away.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>The PC suddenly loses all senses and feels weightless for a split second. In the darkness, they get the creeping thought that something is about to give them the gift of sight, but they know that what they'll see will be awful.
